<p>
    Welcome to the GridLand. All the citizens here are connected through the global internal network because the main way for communication here is via email. Every new district of the city starts with building a node – center of the district. All the citizens will be connected to this node in order to send and receive emails. All nodes of GridLand are connected so one node can send emails between connected nodes. In such a way, no matter how big the city is all users can send messages between each other as long as all of the nodes are connected.</p>
 
<p>The Mayor of GridLand is using this network to quickly send emergency emails to all citizens when necessary. But the system is not perfect. When one of city nodes gets crushed it may leave the citizens of this node district disconnected from these emergency emails. It may also leave districts around the crushed node disconnected if their nodes do not have other ways to connect. To resolve this occurrence, the Mayor uses mail-pigeons – an old method of sending mail that was invented before the global internal network. All of the connected citizens still connected to the network received the emergency emails, but the disconnected citizens receive their from these pigeons.</p>
 
<p>Your mission is to figure out how many pigeons you need when some of the nodes are crushed.</p>
